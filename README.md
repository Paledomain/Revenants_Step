# Revenant's Step
A Tactical Stealth - RPG Game

In Revenant’s Step, A supplicant of Wadjet, Ahura, is betrayed by one of their fellow priests, and killed; only to be reborn as a revenant shortly after. Now, as they wade north to Lower Egypt in the steps of their murderer, they must also find out the reason why they were revived as a revenant.

As a revenant, Ahura makes their way north by following a series of maps as stages where they must catch and interrogate the local boss about the whereabouts of their quarry, so that they can proceed to the next map. However, getting to the boss isn’t easy, as each stage is riddled with the minions of the local boss, patrolling the area.

So, Ahura can try to make their way to the boss without ever being seen by their minions, either by slipping past them or by assassinating them as they go; or they could carve a bloody path to the boss, slashing through every minion in their way. 

There is however, a price to causing a ruckus; because as soon as a minion spots Ahura they’ll shout for help, causing more minions to gather. Not only that, but once there are more than a single minion surrounding Ahura, one of the alerted minions that is currently not engaged with Ahura will escape and run to the next stage, causing this next map to be more difficult when the player is done with here.

So what would make this game fun to play? To answer this, it would be a good idea to look at Page’s description of what makes the game flow (Page, 2015): The first thing that keeps the player hooked on are the “challenges the player encounters”. The challenges the player encounters in this game are mostly on tactical grounds: The player has to make their way to the area boss and slay them. If they are trying to be stealthy, they have to not get in the lines of sight of the NPCs by studying and avoiding their patrol routes, and get to the boss unscathed. Otherwise if they decide to attack anyone head on, they have strategize in a way that they don’t get overwhelmed by the enemies. They have to try and strategically corner enemies, dispose of them and continue, watching their health bar as they go.

The second thing is the rewards and progression. The only reward after every map is more story content, learning the revenant’s backstory little by little and learning about the grave danger Egypt faces. Progression-wise, completing a level unlocks a new level to continue the story from. These new levels include exciting and historically semi-accurate architecture and level design, and feature multiple ways to finish that level, keeping the excitement fresh throughout multiple levels.

A neat thing about the challenges in this game is that the player chooses their own challenge. They can choose to play the game like a stealth-action game, or like a tactics game, or a mix of both, as the only challenge that doesn’t change is slaying the area boss, and how that will be taken care of is completely up to the player.

Another point that would keep the player coming back would be the game’s simplicity. There is no inventory in the game, and controls are very simple: Point and click. For players who play the game not for the story but for the different challenges of the levels themselves, this is a game that is very easy to pick up and put down again. The player doesn’t need to remember anything, just jump in and solve the challenge of how to get to the area boss the most fun way.
